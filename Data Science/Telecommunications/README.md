As stated in the data dictionary, it costs 10 times more to acquire new customers than maintaining current customers. With that being said, stakeholders wanted to understand what customers are at a high risk of churn. My question for this analysis is, â€œWhat factors related to customers are related to churn. The goal of this analysis is to segment the data, so I can understand what factors are closely related to churn. 

For this scenario, I will use hierarchical clustering. I decided to use this clustering technique as hierarchical clustering does not require me to set the number of clusters and instead provides a dendrogram that can help me with making the best decision for a more accurate model. An assumption of this clustering technique is that it will be a higher computational cost, than k-means. This computational cost will be worth it, as it will create a stronger model.
