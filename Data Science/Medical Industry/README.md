Business Problem: 78% of hospitals were fined in 2015 with fewer than 1 in 5 hospitals utilizing technology to reduce readmission.

• Developed a Machine Learning classification model to identify key drivers of hospital readmissions. 
• Built a revenue forecast model to inform strategic data-driven decision-making for executives.
