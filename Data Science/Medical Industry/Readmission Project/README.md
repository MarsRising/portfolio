As an analyst for a popular hospital chain with patients in almost every state in the United States, I am investigating the extent to which readmission is a problem for our chain of hospitals. I am researching this for business as external organizations are penalizing hospitals for excessive readmission, and these penalties have increased every year since its inception. As mentioned in the data dictionary, 78% of hospitals were fined in 2015 with fewer than 1 in 5 hospitals utilizing technology specific to readmission reduction. The stated purpose of my analysis from the stakeholders is to predict readmission based on other conditions and factors of the patient. My real-world organizational question is, “What factors related to the patient are causing readmissions?”. The goal is to understand what factors related to the patient are causing the readmissions so we can effectively analyze ways to stem readmissions and serve our patients more effectively.


I am choosing to use Gradient Boost for my analysis. Gradient Boosting can handle many different variables, as we see in our data, from continuous to ordinal and binary categorical variables. This dataset includes many variables that add complexity, and the analysis results are important for the business to stem readmission and prevent penalties, so using the most effective tool is important. Out of the choices of AdaBoost, Random Forest, and Gradient Boost, the most accurate ML model to use is Gradient Boosting. This performance and accuracy will come at a process time cost. This cost is worth it as we desire accuracy from the results to increase efficiency for our patients and reduce costs

The results of my analysis have answered my business question of what factors related to patients are leading to readmissions. As seen from my graph of feature importance we can see the top 10 variables causing the readmits. Initial days, initial admin, vitamin D levels, complication risk, arthritis, age, and doctor visits are all not surprising at all, as a person who has spent a significant number of days in the initial admission, someone who was admitted for emergency, has low vitamin D, visit the doctor often, and those who have complication risks, are older, and have health issues would logically be more inclined to be readmitted. The income and children I believe could be connected and deserve deeper analysis to understand, if those who have higher income and less children are more likely to visit as they can afford to, or if those who have less income and more children are more likely to visit as they are more concerned for their family’s help and their income negatively impacted choices in their first admission. The population is also another variable where we can infer a few different things, like if a highly populated hospital has less doctor to patient ratio where they are unable to give sufficient time to the patients or even a lower population area is understaffed and causing for insufficient time for patients.


My personal recommendation is to now analyze these variables impacts on readmissions. Gain more details of how they are impacting readmissions, so we can continue to move forward in our goal of stemming penalties and providing the best service to our patients.  While we have all the variables that are impacting readmissions, we do not fully understand how and why they are impacting readmissions. Gathering more details and completing further analysis can bring us the results we need to make the best data-driven decisions moving forward.
