For this project, the executives wanted to consider the revenue from prior years to help us understand the impact of readmission at the current time. Knowing our expected revenue will help illustrate how these readmission penalties will impact our profitability. My research question for this real-world organizational situation is, “Where is our forecast projecting us to go based on historical data?”. This time series analysis aims to understand our projected revenue so the stakeholders can understand the impact of these readmission penalties and how we should move forward.

I was happy with the performance of my model. As seen above, when forecasting over the test data, the forecast fits the test data with 95% confidence and follows the upward trend of the historical data. The confidence interval area has room for improvement, but this can be expected with ARIMA models with complex historical data. The MAE showed a low magnitude of errors at 0.375104 and RMSE is 0.4876186, demonstrating only a low magnitude of errors for the predictions

My analysis has answered our business question. We now know this next year we are forecasted to make more than $20 million, but less than $25 million. Now that we have this information, I suggest further analysis to project how much the readmission penalties will hurt our projected revenue. With profitability in mind, it is important to compare this cost to others and ensure it is significant. When we know it is significant for us, we will know it is one of the costs we should focus on stemming.
