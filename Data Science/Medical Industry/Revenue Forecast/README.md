For this project, the executives wanted to consider the revenue from prior years to help us understand the impact of readmission at the current time. Knowing our expected revenue will help illustrate how these readmission penalties will impact our profitability. My research question for this real-world organizational situation is, “Where is our forecast projecting us to go based on historical data?”. This time series analysis aims to understand our projected revenue so the stakeholders can understand the impact of these readmission penalties and how we should move forward.
