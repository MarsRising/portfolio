# Sentiment Analysis with LSTM Neural Network
For this project, I will use the Yelp dataset containing restaurant reviews. My research question is, “Can we create a neural network that will predict sentiment accurately?”.  This analysis aims to have a neural network that can accurately predict sentiment from restaurant reviews so we can understand how well we have been doing with our customers. The neural network I will be using is the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network. The LSTM network is more efficient due to its ability to remember long-term dependencies, that a recurrent neural network (RNN) struggles with due to vanishing and exploding gradients. It is crucial to understand the context of the customer’s reviews, and with the advanced LSTM capabilities, this would be the best neural network to use.
