# Convolutional Neural Networks
My research question is, “Can we produce a reliable convolutional neural network that successfully classifies crop seedlings from weeds?” The botanist's goal for my research is to solve the classification problem for seedlings using modern analysis techniques. The industry-relevant type of neural network I will use to solve this classification problem is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The reason I am choosing a CNN is due to its efficient image processing, robust to the noise from image data, high accuracy, and automated feature extraction that recognizes the patterns.

The correlation matrix showed me where my CNN was classifying accurately and where it wasn’t classified accurately. While most of the results were decent, I did notice the CNN was having trouble with loose silky-bent. It classified black-grass accurately 10 times, but 28 times it incorrectly identified it as loose silky-belly. This problem could be seen again with common wheat only being accurately classified 7 times, with the CNN inaccurately classifying it as loose silky-bent 17 times. When I first looked at my data I noticed plenty of images of the loose silky-bent, but both black-grass and common wheat had a very small sample size. I would suggest possibly improving this CNN by obtaining more of the black-grass and common wheat. I could also try to augment more of those in the next CNN.

My neural network is functional. The network architecture improved through optimization, as well as from the architecture. SGD’s advantages were obvious with its accuracy and its ability to tune both the learning rate and momentum. Utilizing the learning rate reduction and early stopping helped ensure the best learning rate was being used over time with early stopping reducing overfitting. The validation accuracy is only at about 70% with an accuracy of about 90%. This does demonstrate overfitting, and I do suggest more work be done on this model. I did answer the question of whether I can produce a reliable CNN that can successfully classify seedlings from weeds. Their goal of having their classification problem solved by modern analysis techniques is made, but it is at only about 70%. I learned lessons that improved my CNN. This ranged from data augmentation to provide more data, optimizers like Adam and SGD, and the early stopping to function to reduce overfitting. I recommend further action to increase accuracy. This further action can range from collecting more data on black-grass and common weed, providing more augmented data on the two, or even looking to find other datasets that may align with this project.
