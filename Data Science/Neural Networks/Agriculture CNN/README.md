# Convolutional Neural Networks
My research question is, “Can we produce a reliable convolutional neural network that successfully classifies crop seedlings from weeds?” The botanist's goal for my research is to solve the classification problem for seedlings using modern analysis techniques. The industry-relevant type of neural network I will use to solve this classification problem is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The reason I am choosing a CNN is due to its efficient image processing, robust to the noise from image data, high accuracy, and automated feature extraction that recognizes the patterns.
