The development of my approach matched my expectations. The problem was simple and linear while still having many data points. We could further see that in the simple solution it used. Relying on the hubs for storage needs and utilizing the right methods according to costs, the solution was straightforward and simple. We broke down the steps in Task 2, which helped as an outline. In task 2, we had our parts of the problem broken down into optimization problems, decision variables, constraints, objective functions, and approaches. Task 2 served as a great outline of expectations of the process and allowed me to reference it when establishing the code for this linear programming.
