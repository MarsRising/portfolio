#HEALTHFIT BUSINESS PROBLEM


HealthFit is requesting a scalable database and NoSQL scale both vertically and horizontally. I propose a non-relational database known as NoSQL. The scalability will handle large amounts of data with no performance issues and data silos. The diverse data they receive at an exponential rate will no longer need a relationship and instead can stand alone with just a key and a value. The values can act as different entities due to having their own key. This simple design allows different attributes to be in the values as JSON files that store different descriptive data. This can enable our two different Excel spreadsheets that aren’t seemingly relational to be stored and organized on separate servers. The design will allow for integration and growth without performance issues and analysis of dynamic data
