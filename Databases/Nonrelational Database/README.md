#HEALTHFIT BUSINESS PROBLEM


HealthFit is expanding at a rate their database can’t handle. The database management system (DBMS) they are using is not scalable enough for the amount and variety of data, resulting in performance issues, data silos, and difficulties with integration and analysis. They request a new database design to assess the diverse and dynamic data they collect effectively. 
	I propose a non-relational database known as NoSQL. HealthFit is requesting a scalable database and NoSQL scale both vertically and horizontally. This scalability will handle large amounts of data with no performance issues and data silos. The diverse data they receive at an exponential rate will no longer need a relationship and instead can stand alone with just a key and a value. The values can act as different entities due to having their own key. This simple design allows different attributes to be in the values as JSON files that store different descriptive data. This can enable our two different Excel spreadsheets that aren’t seemingly relational to be stored and organized on separate servers. The design will allow for integration and growth without performance issues and analysis of dynamic data
